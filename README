This is a plugin for TiddlyWeb that creats a cache of ETags.

By default it uses the memcached handling provided by
tiddlywebplugins.caching.

Cache invalidation is handled via store hooks and this trick:

Note the test files are not good tests, there were used to structure
development but do not adequately assert anything.
